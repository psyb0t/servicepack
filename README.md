# servicepack

A Go service framework that runs your shit concurrently without fucking around.

## What is this?

You write services, this thing runs them. All your services go into one binary so you can debug the fuck out of service-to-service calls without dealing with distributed bullshit. Run everything locally, then deploy individual services as microservices when you're ready. Or just fuckin' deploy everything together, y not.

## Quick Start (Make It Your Own in 30 Seconds)

```bash
# Clone this shit
git clone https://github.com/psyb0t/servicepack
cd servicepack

# Make it yours
make own MODNAME=github.com/yourname/yourproject

# Build and run
make build
./build/yourproject run
```

This will:

- Nuke the .git directory
- Replace the module name everywhere
- Set you up with a fresh go.mod
- Replace README with just your project name
- Run `git init` to start fresh
- Setup dependencies
- Create initial commit on main branch

You'll see the hello-world service spamming "Hello, World!" every 5 seconds. Hit Ctrl+C to stop it cleanly.

## Just Want to Try It First?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psyb0t/servicepack
cd servicepack
make build
./build/servicepack run
```

## Creating Services

Create a new service:

```bash
make service NAME=my-cool-service
```

This shits out a skeleton service at `internal/pkg/services/my-cool-service/`. Edit the generated file, put your logic in the `Run()` method. Done - your service starts automatically.

Remove a service:

```bash
make service-remove NAME=my-cool-service
```

## Service Interface

Every service implements this interface:

```go
type Service interface {
    Name() string                        // Return service name
    Run(ctx context.Context) error      // Your service logic goes here
    Stop(ctx context.Context) error     // Cleanup logic (optional)
}
```

The `Run()` method should:

- Listen for `ctx.Done()` and return cleanly when cancelled
- Return an error if something goes wrong (this will stop all services)
- Do whatever the fuck your service is supposed to do

The `Stop()` method is for cleanup - it runs when the app is shutting down.

## How Services Actually Work

1. Services are auto-discovered using the [`gofindimpl`](https://github.com/psyb0t/gofindimpl) tool
2. The `scripts/register_services.sh` script finds all Service implementations
3. It generates `internal/pkg/services/services.gen.go` with a `services.Init()` function
4. The `services.Init()` function is called when the app starts to register all services
5. Services get filtered based on the `SERVICES_ENABLED` environment variable

### Service Filtering

By default, all services run. To run specific services:

```bash
export SERVICES_ENABLED="hello-world,my-cool-service"
./build/servicepack run
```

Leave `SERVICES_ENABLED` empty or unset to run all services.

## The Makefile (Your New Best Friend)

### Basic Commands

- `make build` - Build the binary using Docker (static linking)
- `make dep` - Get dependencies with `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`
- `make test` - Run all tests with race detection
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with 90% coverage requirement (excludes hello-world and cmd packages)
- `make lint` - Lint your code with comprehensive golangci-lint rules (80+ linters enabled)
- `make lint-fix` - Lint and auto-fix issues

### Service Management

- `make service NAME=foo` - Create new service
- `make service-remove NAME=foo` - Remove service
- `make service-registration` - Regenerate service discovery

### Development

- `make run-dev` - Run in development Docker container
- `make docker-build-dev` - Build dev image

### Framework Management

- `make servicepack-update` - Update to latest servicepack framework (creates backup first)
- `make own MODNAME=github.com/you/project` - Make this framework your own

### Backup Management

- `make backup` - Create timestamped backup in `/tmp` and `.backup/`
- `make backup-restore [BACKUP=filename.tar.gz]` - Restore from backup (defaults to latest, nukes everything first)
- `make backup-clear` - Delete all backup files

**Note**: Framework updates (`make servicepack-update`) automatically create backups before making changes.

├── app.go                          # Main app orchestration
├── config.go                       # Configuration parsing

│   ├── errors.go                   # Framework error definitions
│   └── *_test.go                   # Framework tests
└── services/                       # User service space
    ├── services.gen.go             # Auto-generated services.Init() function
    ├── hello-world/                # Example service
    ├── my-cool-service/            # Your service (one dir per service)
    └── another-service/            # Another service
```

### Key Components

**ServiceManager**: Runs your services concurrently, handles shutdown, routes errors. It's a singleton because globals are fine when you know what you're doing.

**Service Registration**: Auto-discovery using [`gofindimpl`](https://github.com/psyb0t/gofindimpl) finds all your Service implementations and generates a `services.Init()` function. No manual registration bullshit.

**App**: Wrapper that runs the ServiceManager and handles the lifecycle shit.

## Environment Variables

The framework uses these:

```bash
# Logging (via logrus-configurator)
LOG_LEVEL=debug          # trace, debug, info, warn, error
LOG_FORMAT=json          # json, text
LOG_CALLER=true          # show file:line in logs

# Service filtering
SERVICES_ENABLED=service1,service2   # comma-separated, empty = all

# Your services can define their own env vars
```

## Build System Details

The build system is dynamic as fuck:

1. App name is extracted from `go.mod` automatically
2. Binary gets built with static linking (no external deps)
3. App name is injected at build time via ldflags
4. Docker builds ensure consistent environment

### Build Process

```makefile
APP_NAME := $(shell head -n 1 go.mod | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')

build:
    docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/app -w /app golang:1.24.6-alpine \
        sh -c "apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev && \
               CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -a \
               -ldflags '-extldflags \"-static\" -X main.appName=$(APP_NAME)' \
               -o ./build/$(APP_NAME) ./cmd/..."
```

This means your binary name matches your module name automatically.

## Framework Updates

Keep your servicepack framework up to date:

```bash
make servicepack-update
```

This script:

1. Checks for uncommitted changes (fails if found)
2. Compares current version with latest
3. Creates backup if update is needed
4. Creates update branch `servicepack_update_to_VERSION`
5. Downloads latest framework and applies changes
6. Commits changes to update branch for review
7. Leaves you on update branch to review and test

### Review and Apply Updates

After running `make servicepack-update`:

```bash
# Review what changed
git diff main..HEAD

# Test the update
make dep && make service-registration && make test

# If satisfied, merge the update
git checkout main
git merge servicepack_update_to_VERSION

# If not satisfied, discard the update
git checkout main
git branch -D servicepack_update_to_VERSION
```

### Customizing Updates with .servicepackupdateignore

Create a `.servicepackupdateignore` file to exclude files from framework updates:

```
# Custom framework modifications
Makefile
Dockerfile.dev
scripts/custom_deploy.sh

# Local configuration files
*.local
.env*
```

**Framework vs User Files**:

```
cmd/                           # Framework files
internal/app/                  # Framework files
internal/pkg/service-manager/  # Framework files
scripts/                       # Framework files
Makefile                       # Framework files
Dockerfile.dev                 # Framework files
.github/                       # Framework files (CI/CD workflows)
LICENSE                        # Your project license
.golangci.yml                  # Framework files
go.mod                         # Your module name preserved
go.sum                         # Gets regenerated
README.md                      # Your project docs
internal/pkg/services/         # Your services - never touched
```

Use `.servicepackupdateignore` to exclude any framework files you've customized.

## Pre-commit Hook

There's a `pre-commit.sh` script that runs `make lint && make test-coverage`. You can:

- Use your favorite pre-commit tool to manage hooks
- Use [`ez-pre-commit`](https://github.com/psyb0t/ez-pre-commit) to auto-setup Git hooks that run this script
- Just use the simple script as-is (it runs lint and coverage checks)

## Testing

Tests are structured per component:

- `internal/app/app_test.go` - Application tests with mock services
- `internal/pkg/services/service_manager_test.go` - Service manager tests with concurrency testing
- `internal/pkg/services/errors_test.go` - Error definition and matching tests
- Each service should have its own `*_test.go` files

90% test coverage is required by default (excludes hello-world service). The coverage check runs with race detection and fails if below threshold.

### Test Isolation

- `ResetInstance()` resets the singleton for clean test state
- `ClearServices()` clears all registered services
- Mock services implement the Service interface for testing
- Tests should avoid calling `services.Init()` and manually add mock services instead

## Concurrency Model

- Each service runs in its own goroutine
- ServiceManager uses sync.WaitGroup for coordination
- Context cancellation for clean shutdown
- Services can fail independently (one failure stops all)
- Graceful shutdown with configurable timeout

## Error Handling

- Service errors bubble up through the ServiceManager
- First error stops all services
- Context errors (cancellation) are treated as clean shutdown
- All errors use [`ctxerrors`](https://github.com/psyb0t/ctxerrors) for context preservation
- `ErrNoEnabledServices` is returned when no services are registered (empty service list)

## Future Features (TODO)

- **Service Retry**: When a service shits itself, check retry count and restart the fucker if it hasn't hit the limit yet
- **Allowed Failures**: Let some services die without killing everything - useful for one-shot jobs like migrators that run once and fuck off
- **Service Dependencies**: Let services say "I need this other shit to start first" so database comes up before API and shit
- **Health Checks**: Built-in endpoints to check if services are alive or dead with timeouts and failure limits
- **Management API**: HTTP endpoint to see what's running and control the bastards (start/stop/restart individual services)
- **Metrics**: Track startup times, failure counts, restart counts and optionally export to Prometheus
- **Service Communication**: Built-in message passing so services can talk to each other instead of figuring that shit out themselves
