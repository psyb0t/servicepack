# Changelog

All notable changes per release. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org)
pre-1.0 conventions: minor bumps may include breaking API changes (called out
explicitly), patch bumps are docs / build / fixes only.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-07-26

Coverage reporting to Codecov + README badges.

- **Codecov coverage upload.** `pipeline.yml` enables the reusable workflow's
  Codecov step; `make test-coverage` keeps `coverage.txt` (previously deleted
  on exit) so CI can upload it.
- **README badges.** pkg.go.dev reference + GitHub Actions CI status badges. No
  library code changed.
