# gonfiguration ðŸ”§

A kickass configuration package for Golang. Because, why the hell not? Simplify setting defaults and setting struct field vals from env vars without the unnecessary bullshit.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/psyb0t/gonfiguration"
)

type config struct {
	ListenAddress string `env:"LISTEN_ADDRESS"`
	DBDSN         string `env:"DB_DSN"`
	DBName        string `env:"DB_NAME"`
	DBUser        string `env:"DB_USER"`
	DBPass        string `env:"DB_PASS"`
}

func main() {
	cfg := config{}

	gonfiguration.SetDefaults(map[string]interface{}{
		"LISTEN_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8080",
		"DB_DSN":         "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable",
	})

	if err := os.Setenv("DB_NAME", "postgres"); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("holy fuque! can't set env: %v", err)
	}

	if err := os.Setenv("DB_USER", "postgres-user"); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("holy fuque! can't set env: %v", err)
	}

	if err := os.Setenv("DB_PASS", "postgres-pass"); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("holy fuque! can't set env: %v", err)
	}

	if err := gonfiguration.Parse(&cfg); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("holy fuque! can't parse config: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", cfg) //nolint:forbidigo
}
```

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/psyb0t/gonfiguration
```

## Usage

Alright, let's break it down:

### Step 1: Define Your Config Struct

Define your configuration struct. This badass package is all about keeping it simple. It only vibes with simple structs that don't piss me off. If your config's looking like a damn novel, maybe it's time to split that project into bite-sized chunks. And by the way, those env tags? They're your env var's alter ego. Get it right!

Here's a sweet little example:

```go
type MyAwesomeConfig struct {
    ListenAddress string `env:"LISTEN_ADDRESS"`
    DBDSN         string `env:"DB_DSN"`
    DBName        string `env:"DB_NAME"`
    DBUser        string `env:"DB_USER"`
    DBPass        string `env:"DB_PASS"`
}
```

### Step 2: Set Some Defaults (If You're Into That)

You can set defaults that'll make your life easier. They're like your wingman, always there when no one else is:

```go
gonfiguration.SetDefaults(map[string]interface{}{
    "LISTEN_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8080",
    // ... and so on for your other config variables.
})
```

### Step 3: Parse It Like You Mean It

Make `gonfiguration` work for you. Tell it to grab those env vars and slap 'em into your config struct:

```go
cfg := MyAwesomeConfig{}
if err := gonfiguration.Parse(&cfg); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("whoa there, partner! can't parse config: %v", err)
}
```

And BAM! Your app's environment is now fresher than a mint garden.

### Step 4: (Optional) Get All Values Because You're Nosy

Just wanna see all the values? We got you:

```go
allTheSecrets := gonfiguration.GetAllValues()
// Now go forth and spill those beans.
```

### Step 5: Hit The Reset Button When You Wanna Start Over

Overdid it? Call in a mulligan and reset those defaults and env vars:

```go
gonfiguration.Reset()
```

## Development

### Makefile

Run these bad boys:

- `make dep` for dependency management.
- `make lint` to lint all your Golang files because nobody likes messy code.
- `make test` for the usual tests.
- `make test-coverage` to see if you're covering your ass enough with tests.

For a full list of commands:

```bash
make help
```
